## Bike Mayhem
An infinite game with roads, bikes, and powerups. There are special blocks, including a barrel that you can push into cars to destroy them, a speedup and slowdown powerup, and an immunity combined with a speed boost.

(Currently doens't have a public link, will have one soon (update: still doesn't have one for some reason even after it was approved))
